Create OAuthToken with following permissions in your repository:
    - repo - used for full control to read and pull artifacts from public and private repositories into a pipeline.
    - admin:repo_hook - used for full control of repository hooks.
    
Create following secrets in aws secret manager:
 - GitHubAuth -> Key-value secret 
    - Key = token, value = xxx
 
When running create-stack:
create-stack --template-body "serverless-template.yml" --parameters RepositoryName=repoName BranchName=branch  GitHubOwner=repoOwner --capabilities "CAPABILITY_IAM,CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND,CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM"
You can leave the parameters section to leave them as default.

When stack is created you must check 'AWSDbConnection' secret to access database connection string automatically created for you.
Then use `MySQL Workbench` or `mysql` command to run `hrpotter-db.sql` script, which will populate database with data and tables.
